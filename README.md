## Overview
This room involves exploiting a secure website to gain access to the system and retrieve the user and root flags.

## Steps
1. **User Flag**

     ```
     THM{S**********0ck_r0ckz}
     ```

2. **Root Flag**
   - Successfully retrieved the `root.txt` flag:
     ```
     THM{g00d_******day_is_Pleased}
     ```

## Tools and Techniques Used
- Website enumeration
- Exploitation of vulnerabilities
- (msfconsole, gobuster, etc)
- (cve-2014-6271 - shellshock, linpeas.sh)

## Notes
This room provided a hands-on experience with **0-day exploits** and required lateral thinking to achieve root access.
